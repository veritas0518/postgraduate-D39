Today is really a difficult day. I went to class in the morning, and I didn't bring a computer. In order to occupy seats in the library, I didn't expect that the embedded development class in the morning was an experimental class. The teacher didn't say anything, so we had to do it by ourselves. I was really convinced. Fortunately, I didn't call the roll. I was a few minutes late, but I sat there and didn't do anything, Fortunately, I typed a little bit of code and didn't waste my time. I have been told the situation in the afternoon courses. I wonder if the teacher will give me high marks. Alas, I am tired. It is very troublesome to run around to get out of a country.
